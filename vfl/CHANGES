0.7.14 - removed support for mtime-based options as they are now superfluous

0.7.13 - added md5 hash based version names

0.7.3 - miscellaneous bug fixes for fringe cases with svn

0.7 - added switch to allow using mtime instead of svn revision for versioning

0.5 - enabled incremental build - svn is just too slow to query every time. indexes are backward compatible by default.

0.4 - stable production release
