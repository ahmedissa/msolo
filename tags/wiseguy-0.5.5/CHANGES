0.5.5 - added support for alternate profilers and remote fetching of profile
data.

0.5.4 - added support for unix domain sockets. misc cleanup.

0.5.3 - requires py-fastcgi-1.3, adds support for a timeout between the
accept() and the first read() on the input socket. this should fix an issue
with half-opened connections stacking up and causing the server to hang.

0.5.1 - validate the memory usage keys in linux_get_memory_usage to prevent
crash bug in the 'boss' process

0.5 - removed all of the stats code. this is better handled as another separate
module. see spyglass.

0.4.1 - added linux-specific memory supervisor and added more error handling
in the manager.

0.4 - a good, stable release
