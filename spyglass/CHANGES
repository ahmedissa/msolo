0.8 - added time_updated tracking for individual stats, making them prunable
so key polution is self-repairing after an hour or so. make most whole-file
writes atomic.

0.7 - added percentile breakdown for execution time stats.
added new /server-rates handler for decay stats.
factored out a few keys that were wsgi specific.

0.6.3 - cleaned up exponential decay rates
fixed for network code for python 2.6

0.6.2 - implemented better time-based periodic execution.

0.6.1 - enable deferred io by default. fixed up key validation. refactored
periodic execution. seems a bit too "random" at this point - might have to
redo it again to be more time-based.

0.6 - added deferred io so regular writing of the proc and state files don't
block the event loop when the disks on the host machine are busy. prune unused
keys after some period of inactivity. reject unruly key patterns in the client
and periodically revalidate entries in the rate map.

0.5.1 - patch to prevent exception when you query after a restart and there are no stats

0.5 - added http thread to the server process to handle stats requests
decomped the handler code so UDP and TCP protocols can use the same routines
added new summarization routines
added support for the type of stats that wiseguy used to track

0.4.1 - removed senseless timeouts on the server side
improved handling of empty responses

0.4 - further tweaks to SPUDP - added generic server. added event history - no
longer just approximate rates, but some amount of data for a fixed window of
time (15 minutes). added lifetime event window (not sure how useful this is).

0.3 - replace ad hoc udp crap with SPUDP - more robust packet handler

0.2.1 - a good, stable release
