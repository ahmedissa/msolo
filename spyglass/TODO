 * remove items from the historical counters
   * might need to start recording update times to track when a value is stale
 * some kind of integration with RRD to allow more data tracking
   * not sure if there is any benefit to putting more RRA inside one RRD
     * does reduce the total number of files per directory
     * might be cheaper to only have to update few files
 * what is the best way to do the proc file? could a fifo be made to act as a
   notification?
   * have a separate thread blocked on os.open('spyglass.proc', os.O_RDONLY)
   * build it all into the http handler and rely on curl?
 * write the procfile atomically
 * make spyglass rotate its primary log
